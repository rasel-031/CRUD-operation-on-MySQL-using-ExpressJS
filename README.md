# CRUD-operation-on-MySQL-using-ExpressJS
In this project, I am basically doing that a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operation on the MYSQL database. I showed that how to handle Formdata (content-type: multipart/formdata) with Files through an API using express js. And also, how to store that files via third-party multer middleware in express js.
